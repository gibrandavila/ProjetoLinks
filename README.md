<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is the result of Rocket Seat's discovery course, which i have done and i am very proud because it became a website that i use in my social media links.

This project was developed as a personalized adaptation of the Linktree platform, incorporating both visual and functional enhancements. While it draws structural inspiration from the original model, I implemented a distinct aesthetic and introduced features to better align with my personal and professional objectives.

The application was built using three foundational web technologies: HTML for content structuring, CSS for visual presentation, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction. Throughout the development process, I encountered specific challenges related to CSS, particularly in layout and responsiveness, which highlighted areas for further study and skill refinement.

One of the key functionalities of this project is a toggle mechanism that allows users to switch between dark and light display modes, enhancing user accessibility and experience. In addition, the interface includes four primary buttons that serve as links to curated content—such as professional highlights, projects, or external resources—that I aim to showcase.

At the bottom of the interface, four discreet social media icons link to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles. There is also an icon designed to facilitate direct messaging, enabling quick and convenient communication.

Overall, this project demonstrates not only my current technical competencies but also my commitment to continuous improvement through practical application and iterative development.

## Usage

It is a functional website with my personal links.

The main objective of this application is to consolidate access to academic and professional materials in a single interface. By organizing key resources such as your academic résumé, research outputs, institutional achievements, and social profiles, this hub simplifies the process of connecting with colleagues, academic committees, and prospective collaborators.

The minimalist structure ensures fast navigation and encourages users to engage with the content that matters most.

**Profile Image and Username** <br> <br>
	•	Positioned at the top of the screen, the circular profile photo provides a personal touch and conveys credibility. <br>
	•	The username @gibran.davila reinforces brand consistency and can be aligned with other platforms where you maintain an academic presence.<br><br>

**Theme Toggle Button (Light/Dark Mode)** <br><br>
	•	Centrally located under the username, the toggle switch enables users to change the appearance of the interface based on their viewing preference.<br>
	•	Ideal for improving accessibility and comfort in different lighting conditions, such as during academic presentations, online interviews, or reading in low-light environments. <br><br>

 **Main Navigation Buttons** <br> <br>  

Four prominent rectangular buttons provide direct access to key content areas:<br><br>
	1.	Currículo Lattes<br>
Redirects to your official CV on the Lattes platform, where visitors can find detailed information about your academic background, education, publications, and professional experience.<br>
	2.	Published Research <br>
Leads to a collection or list of your academic publications, which may include journal articles, conference papers, working papers, or book chapters. <br>
	3.	FGV Award <br>
Highlights an academic achievement or institutional recognition received at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), adding credibility and distinction to your profile.
	4.	Most Recent Publication <br>
Direct link to your latest scholarly output, allowing viewers to quickly access the most current contribution to your field.<br>

Each button is styled consistently for visual harmony and includes a hover effect to indicate interactivity. <br><br>

 **Social Media Icons (Bottom Row)** <br><br> 

Below the main content area are four minimalist icons that serve as direct links to your digital presence: <br><br>
	•	LinkedIn: Professional network profile, ideal for showcasing work experience, collaborations, and academic engagement. <br>
	•	GitHub: Portfolio of code repositories, projects, or academic tools that demonstrate technical proficiency. <br>
	•	Instagram: A more informal channel for sharing scientific outreach, public events, or personal milestones.<br>
	•	Direct Messaging: A communication shortcut—may link to a WhatsApp contact, email form, or messaging app to facilitate direct contact with you.<br><br>

These icons maintain a monochromatic design to align with the minimalist aesthetic of the page.<br><br>
  **Footer and Attribution** <br><br>
  At the bottom of the interface, a subtle attribution line reads: <br>
by @gibran.davila <br> <br>
